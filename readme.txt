Here is a [step-by-step guide to creating WooCommerce abandoned cart email campaigns](https://help.retainful.com/automations/abandoned-cart-recovery-email-campaign)

### Email Campaigns

Design and send beautiful WoCommerce [email campaigns](https://www.retainful.com/email-campaign/). Get started quickly using our beautiful templates and powerful visual customer journey builder - which are easy to use, even if you are not a designer or a developer.

- Create beautiful email campaigns using our readymade templates and drag-and-drop email editor.

- Personalize your WooCommerce automated emails with dynamic content such as customer name, address, and more.

- Use the Smart Sending feature to send or schedule your campaigns at the recipient’s time zone for better engagement and conversion.

- Send more targeted WooCommerce email campaigns by segmenting customers. Use our powerful segmentation feature to segment customers based on demographics, purchase history, engagement, and more.

- Measure your WooCommerce email campaign performance using our powerful reporting - opens, clicks, bounces, and more.

- Improve your email deliverability by automatically cleaning your list using our automated bounce handling & suppression features.

- Send branded WordPress email campaigns in your own domain name and be compliant with the recent Google and Yahoo sender requirements.

### High email deliverability

The WooCommerce email marketing plugin allows you to set up your email-sending domain that helps verify the emails are genuinely from you, reducing the likelihood of them being flagged as spam.

### Smart sending

Smart Sending lets you define a timeframe (e.g., 8 hours, 24 hours) within which customers won't receive more than one email from you. This applies to all WooCommerce email campaigns and workflows.

### Email Automation

Retainful’s [WordPress email marketing automation](https://www.retainful.com/marketing-automation/) allows you to send the right message to the right person at the right time automatically.

Once set up, the automation workflows automatically send WooCommerce follow-up emails every time a customer performs an action in your store - signing up for your newsletter, purchasing a product, abandoning the cart, or being inactive for a while.

You can access any one of these workflows in the Free Plan as well. NOTE: You need to upgrade to access all of these workflows and use the WooCommerce email automation to the fullest.

Retainful has pre-built automation workflows like:

- **Abandoned cart recovery email:** A series of WooCommerce cart recovery emails triggered automatically and sent out at well-timed intervals.

- **Welcome emails:** Once setup, sent only for the first time buyers to create a great first impression with a warm welcome message.

- **Thank you email with the next-order coupon:** When a customer places an order in your store, Retainful can automatically generate a unique, single-use coupon code for their next purchase and send it to the customer. Once set up, no manual actions are required.

- **WooCommerce Order follow-up emails:** Send order confirmation, product tips, and feedback request emails in a single pre-built workflow.

- **Product review request email:** Request a product review a few days after the purchase.

### WordPress Email Newsletters

Sending WordPress email newsletters is the key to connecting with your customers and nurturing them beyond just prompting them to purchase.

You can create stunning WordPress email newsletters effortlessly with pre-designed email templates and a drag-and-drop email editor of this email marketing plugin for WooCommerce.

Some of the pre-built WooCommerce email newsletter template Retainful offers are:

- Product launch template
- Product recommendation template
- Feedback request template
- Back-in-stock template
- Product-specific follow-up template

### Sign-up forms

Growing your email list is the first step in doing successful WooCommerce email marketing.

The sign-up form is a [pop-up](https://www.retainful.com/popups/) that prompts visitors on your site to provide their email contact, converting casual visitors into leads.

With Retainful, you can create targeted popups that are tuned to visitor behavior and displayed at the right time to get the conversion.

You can create 4 types of popups with Retainful:

- **Welcome popup** - Appears when a visitor first lands on your website. It provides a warm greeting and often includes a special offer to encourage immediate engagement.

- **Add-to-cart popup**- Appears immediately after the customer clicks “Add to Cart” button and collects the email address before checkout, allowing you to send a cart reminder if it ends up in cart abandonment.

- **Exit-Intent popup** - Triggered when a visitor intends to leave your site. It serves as a last-minute

- **Embed form** - It can be placed or integrated on the layout of the page of your site or in specific areas such as the footer or sidebar.

- **General popup**- Triggered based on specific conditions you set, such as time spent on the site, scroll depth, or clicks on particular elements.

### Email Segmentation

Segmenting your email list allows you to send personalized WooCommerce email campaigns that resonate with the customer and increase conversions.

This WooCommerce email marketing plugin allows you to segment your customers based on demographics, purchase history, email engagement, and more.

Not only does it have various segmentation criteria, but you can implement it in a few simple steps.

You can choose predefined email [segmentation](https://www.retainful.com/email-segmentation) templates like abandoned cart customers, inactive customers, VIP customers, new customers, and active email subscribers, or you can create your own rules from scratch.

For example, you can segment abandoned cart customers in multiple ways in Retainful - such as abandoned date, abandoned product name, total number of abandoned carts, and cart value, among others.

Here is a guide on [how to segment your email list](https://help.retainful.com/list-and-segments/getting-started-with-list-and-segments/?utm_source=wp_repo&utm_medium=wp_email_segmentation&utm_campaign=email+segmentation&utm_id=wp_retainful)
